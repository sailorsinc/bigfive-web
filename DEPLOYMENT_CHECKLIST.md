# Railway Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to deploy your API to Railway.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] OpenAI API key ready (`sk-...`)
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] Railway account created
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub

## Railway Setup

- [ ] Create new Railway project
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Add MongoDB database (Railway plugin or Atlas)
- [ ] Generate public domain

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway â†’ Variables:

- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-your-actual-key`
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` = `${{MONGO_URL}}` or MongoDB Atlas URL
- [ ] `DB_COLLECTION` = `results`
- [ ] `PORT` = `3001`
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [ ] `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` = `*` (or specific domains)
- [ ] `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` = `100`

## Deployment

- [ ] Railway auto-deploys from GitHub
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Check deployment status (green checkmark)
- [ ] Copy public URL

## Testing

- [ ] **Health check**: `curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
  - Should return `{"status": "healthy"}`

- [ ] **Validate endpoint**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/analyze/validate \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"transcript": "Test transcript with at least 100 characters to meet the minimum requirement for validation testing purposes."}'
  ```
  - Should return quality metrics

- [ ] **Analyze endpoint**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/analyze \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "transcript": "Interviewer: Tell me about yourself.\n\nCandidate: I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience. I love working on complex problems and collaborating with teams. In my last role, I led a project that reduced system latency by 40% through careful optimization and refactoring. I enjoy mentoring junior developers and I am always eager to learn new technologies.",
      "language": "en",
      "jobRole": "Software Engineer"
    }'
  ```
  - Should return analysis with ID and scores

- [ ] **Get results**:
  ```bash
  curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/results/YOUR_ID_HERE?includeEvidence=true
  ```
  - Should return full analysis with evidence

## Monitoring

- [ ] Check Railway logs (Logs tab)
- [ ] Check Railway metrics (CPU, RAM)
- [ ] Set up alerts (Settings â†’ Alerts)
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI usage (platform.openai.com/usage)

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add custom domain (Settings â†’ Domains)
- [ ] Add API key authentication
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling
- [ ] Add Redis for caching
- [ ] Create client SDK

## Documentation

- [ ] Update API base URL in docs
- [ ] Share API documentation with team
- [ ] Create example requests for your use case
- [ ] Document any custom configurations

## Security Review

- [ ] CORS origins configured correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] MongoDB access restricted
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (Railway default)
- [ ] Health check working
- [ ] Error messages don't leak secrets

## Cost Management

- [ ] Review Railway plan (Free â†’ Hobby if needed)
- [ ] Set OpenAI spending limits
- [ ] Monitor token usage
- [ ] Set up budget alerts
- [ ] Review MongoDB storage limits

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Can analyze transcripts successfully
- [ ] Can retrieve results by ID
- [ ] Response times < 30 seconds
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] All tests passing

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

- [ ] Railway â†’ Deployments â†’ Select previous version â†’ Rollback
- [ ] Or: `railway rollback` (CLI)
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Test locally first before redeploying

## After Deployment

1. âœ… API is live and accessible
2. âœ… Share URL with your team
3. âœ… Integrate with your applications
4. âœ… Monitor usage and costs
5. âœ… Iterate and improve

**Congratulations! Your API is deployed! ðŸŽ‰**
