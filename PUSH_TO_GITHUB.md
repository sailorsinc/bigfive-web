# Push to GitHub - Step by Step

## Option 1: Use the Script (Easiest)

I've created a script that does everything for you:

```bash
cd /Users/sankarmacmini/bigfive-web
./push-to-github.sh
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Check git status
2. ✅ Stage all changes
3. ✅ Create commit
4. ✅ Push to GitHub

---

## Option 2: Manual Commands

If you prefer to do it manually:

### Step 1: Check Git Status

```bash
cd /Users/sankarmacmini/bigfive-web
git status
```

### Step 2: Add Remote (if not already added)

**First time only:**

```bash
# If you haven't created a GitHub repo yet:
# 1. Go to github.com
# 2. Click "New Repository"
# 3. Name it: bigfive-web
# 4. Don't initialize with README (you already have code)
# 5. Copy the URL

# Then add it as remote:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bigfive-web.git

# Or with SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bigfive-web.git
```

**Check if remote exists:**

```bash
git remote -v
```

### Step 3: Stage All Changes

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 4: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Add BigFive Interview Transcript API with Railway deployment

- Add standalone API server (Express + TypeScript)
- Add transcript analyzer package with GPT-4 integration
- Add content quality validation
- Add Railway deployment configuration
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Add rate limiting and security features
- Ready for production deployment"
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

**First time:**

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**Or if branch is already tracked:**

```bash
git push
```

---

## Option 3: VS Code (If you use VS Code)

1. Open VS Code in the project folder
2. Click **Source Control** icon (left sidebar)
3. Click **+** next to "Changes" to stage all
4. Type commit message
5. Click **✓ Commit**
6. Click **...** → **Push**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No remote repository"

You need to create a GitHub repository first:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `bigfive-web`
3. Make it Public or Private
4. **Don't** initialize with README
5. Click **Create repository**
6. Copy the URL
7. Run: `git remote add origin YOUR_URL`

### Error: "Authentication failed"

**For HTTPS:**
```bash
# Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
# Create one at: github.com/settings/tokens
```

**For SSH:**
```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub at: github.com/settings/keys
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### Error: "Updates were rejected"

Someone else pushed changes. Pull first:

```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```

### Already have commits but no remote?

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What Happens After Push?

Once you push to GitHub:

1. ✅ Code is backed up on GitHub
2. ✅ You can deploy to Railway
3. ✅ Others can clone/fork your repo
4. ✅ Auto-deploy on future pushes

---

## Next: Deploy to Railway

After pushing to GitHub, deploy to Railway:

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app/)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Choose `bigfive-web`
5. Follow: [SIMPLE_RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md](SIMPLE_RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md)

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage everything
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Your message"

# Push
git push origin main

# View remote
git remote -v

# View logs
git log --oneline -5
```
